Description
Handles user-related information, including registration, login, profile management, and preferences.

Getting Started

This section will guide you through setting up and running the project.

Prerequisites

Python 3.x (Рекомендуется 3.7 или выше) (Recommended 3.7 or higher) - Download Python
pip (usually comes bundled with Python)
Installation

Clone the repository:

Bash
git clone {GIT_CLONE_HTTPS}.git

Create a virtual environment (recommended):

A virtual environment isolates project dependencies and avoids conflicts with other Python projects on your system.

Bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # For Linux/macOS
env\Scripts\activate.bat  # For Windows

Install dependencies:

Bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Use code with caution.

Additional Notes

For detailed usage instructions and API documentation (if applicable), refer to the project's source code and any additional documentation provided.

Running the Project

Navigate to the project directory:

Bash
cd your_project_name
Use code with caution.

Run the application:

PowerShell
uvicorn src.api.main:app --reload

This will start the application.

Advanced Topics

This section covers more advanced topics for experienced users.

Using a Makefile

A Makefile can automate tasks like installing dependencies, running tests, and building the project. You can find an example Makefile in the project's root directory (Makefile). Refer to the Makefile documentation for specific usage instructions.

Using Docker Compose

Docker Compose allows you to run the project in a containerized environment. If the project includes a docker-compose.yml file, you can use the following command to start the application in a container:

Bash
docker-compose up
Use code with caution.

Further Documentation

For more details about Python development, refer to the official Python documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/
For unit testing with pytest, refer to the pytest documentation: https://docs.pytest.org/
For working with virtual environments, refer to the documentation for your preferred virtual environment tool (e.g., venv or virtualenv).
